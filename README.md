## Django Backend for Multi-Step Form
This is the backend for a React-powered multi-step form. It handles storing form data in a JSON file and provides endpoints to retrieve and update the data.

📁 Features
Accepts form submissions via POST.

Retrieves stored form data via GET.

Updates existing data via PUT.

Data is stored in a form_data.json file.

No models or serializers used — pure views-based approach.
